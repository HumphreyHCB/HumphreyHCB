### 💡 About Me

I’m a PhD researcher in the **Programming Languages & Systems group** at the **University of Kent**, supervised by [Dr Stefan Marr](https://stefan-marr.de/).  
My research focuses on a long-standing challenge: **why Java profilers are so inaccurate, and why they disagree on what’s “hot.”**  
Sampling profilers often mislead developers, while traditional instrumentation can distort performance by **orders of magnitude**.  

I’m developing a **instrumentation for the Graal compiler** that:

- 🧩 Inserts lightweight probes after all optimisation phases — leaving the compiler’s behaviour unchanged.  
- ⚙️ Combines **sampling** to locate hot code with **instrumentation** to zoom in precisely.  

Beyond building better profilers, I’m also designing **techniques to measure profiler accuracy itself**, introducing *controlled slowdowns* that reveal whether profilers can detect the *true* performance behavior.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Produce accurate profiles with minimal overhead — and a reliable way to prove it's accuracy.
